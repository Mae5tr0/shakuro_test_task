# Shakuro test exam on backend developer position 

## Requirements.
- Publishers produce books that are sold in shops.
- A book can be distributed via multiple shops.
- A shop can sell multiple copies of a book.

## What should to be done

Please model the required database relations and create API Endpoints described below.
The code should be covered with tests (rspec).

### Endpoint 1

For a specific Publisher it should return the list of shops selling at least one book of that publisher. 
Shops should be ordered by the number of books sold. Each shop should include the list of Publisherâ€™s books that are 
currently in stock. 

Example response:
```json
{
  "shops": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Amazon",
      "books_sold_count": 10,
      "books_in_stock": [
        {
          "id": 2,
          "title": "Yiddish songs",
          "copies_in_stock": 3
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Endpoint 2

 For a specific Shop it should mark one or multiple copies of a book as sold.
 
# Requirements

Because it's test project and ruby version does not specified I used last version.

* Ruby 2.5.1
* MySQL

# How to run

* Install dependencies
```sh
bundle install
```

* Create databases
```sh
bundle exec rails db:create db:migrate
```

* For local development you can populate db with random data:
```sh
bundle exec rails db:seed
```

* Run server
```sh
bundle exec rails server
```

* Run specs
```sh
bundle exec rspec
```

* Run rubocop
```sh
bundle exec rubocop
```

# Implementation notes

We have two main strategies here - load more data from DB and process it in ruby or create more complicated SQL for
receiving only what we want. I chose the second way with more complicated queries. Advantages: more effective way 
for loading and processing data, disadvantages - complicated SQL is more difficult to support, db specific.

Endpoint 1
```http
GET publishers/:id/shops
```

Endpoint 2
```http
POST shops/:id/sold_out with json in body {"ids": ["book_id_1", "book_id_2", "...etc"]}
```
